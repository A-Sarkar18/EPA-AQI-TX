# Vizualizing Texas Air Quality over the Decade

## Project Description
I was interested in evaulating average annual Air Quality in Texas throughout the years by using air monitor data.

## Background
The U.S. EPA calculates the Air Quality Index for five major air pollutants know as the "Criteria Pollutants" regulated by the Clean Air Act (CAA): ground-level ozone, particle pollution (also known as particulate matter), carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide. The U.S. EPA has established National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) to protect public health that indicates acceptable levels for each of the pollutants. The Texas Comission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) monitors ground-level ozone, particulate matter, carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide using the AQI.
